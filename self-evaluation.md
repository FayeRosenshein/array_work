# How confident do I feel?

  * I feel pretty confident in my array knowledge and skill. So far I can do the assignment without many errors.

  * I would like to know more about how to use arrays when the elements are too big to count and how to list them when you don't know the position they are in in the array.

  *I don't have any questions about arrays.
